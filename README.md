# 👋 Hey, I’m Alex Dickinson

🎮 **Game Developer** | 💻 **Software Engineer** | 🧠 **Problem Solver** | 🛹 Skate & Board Sports Enthusiast

Hey! I’m Alex - a technical and adaptable developer with a strong foundation in C#, Python, and C++. I graduated from the University of Lincoln in 2025 with a first class honours, and have been working in DevOps for nearly two years. Whether it’s gameplay mechanics, AI behaviours, procedural generation, or real-time simulations, I’m all about making things that run smooth and run as best as they can. I pick up new tools fast, pay close attention to detail, and thrive under pressure. I run my own LTD company called **Byte Sky Games**, which I publish all my indie games under :)
